## 🎈 Usage <a name ="usage"></a>

- The application consists of 3 pages:
  - A homepage with a menu
  - A page displaying a catalog of cars with filters for brand, rental price per
    year, and mileage.
  - A page with ads that have been added to favorites by the user
- Possibility to clear one or all the filters
- A modal window that displays detailed information about the car and its rental
  conditions.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

- The production version of the project will be automatically built and deployed
  to GitHub Pages, in the gh-pages branch, every time the main branch is
  updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. To do
  this, you need to edit the base field in the vite.config.js file, replacing it
  with your repository name "/your_repo_name", and send the changes to GitHub.

- Next, you need to go to the settings of the GitHub repository (Settings >
  Pages) and expose the distribution of the production version of the files from
  the /root folder of the gh-pages branch, if this was not done automatically.
